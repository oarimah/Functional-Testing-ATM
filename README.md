# Functional-Testing-ATM

In this project, I have applied three of foundational black box techniques on the ATM system.

The focal points of this project is the withdrawal, the deposit, and the transfer operations.

Each of these operations has their own business logic for calculating banking fees for the given operation.

For each of the JUnit tests you can find:

The test cases I have created. This has two sections. In the first section I just commented on the process and the assumptions I have used to calculate the test cases, using the analysis technique for the corresponding case. In the second section I have the tables with the test cases.

The test results. This provides a table indicating the test case and whether the test passed or failed.

The archive with the systemâ€™s code along with the JUnit code with which I ran my tests.
